# SCC330

This is the React Native mobile app I developed for one of two IoT group projects during the third year of my Software Engineering BSc. It was carried out October - December 2019 and the source code is unchanged since then.

At the time, this was done using a remote repo hosted at the uni, so in order to showcase it here I copied my local version of the project, initialised a new repo, updated dependencies and pushed it here.

The app was only ever built for Android and on Windows. Any remote resources fetched during runtime will fail as the servers were taken down long ago. However to see the blank UI in action, clone this repo, connect an Android device or emulator and run `yarn && yarn android`.
