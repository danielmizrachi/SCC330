# SCC330

This is the mobile app I developed for the first of two IoT group projects carried out September - December 2019 during the third year of my Software Engineering BSc. **The source code is unchanged since then**.

At the time, this was done using a remote repo hosted at the uni, so in order to showcase it here I copied the project, initialised a new repo, updated dependencies and pushed it here.
